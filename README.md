# Revenge

A modification for Discord mobile apps. Continuation of [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod). Get it? Vendetta is like, revenging..., yeah.

> [!WARNING]
> Revenge is still being worked on! Please understand that you may encounter some issues.

## ⬇️ Installing

### Android

#### Non-root

1. Install [Vendetta Manager](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/VendettaManager/releases/latest/download/Manager.apk)
2. Download _(don't install!)_ the latest [Xposed module](https://github.com/revenge-mod/RevengeXposed/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk)
3. Go to Vendetta Manager's **Settings > About** and press version number **10 times**
4. Set **Custom Xposed module location** to:
   `    /storage/emulated/0/Download/app-release.apk
   `

   > [!NOTE]
   > This is default location of downloaded module if you use the default `Downloads` folder **and** you don't have any file with the same name saved. If these two conditions don't match, you will have to change the path respectively.

5. Head back to main screen and install!

#### Root

1. Install an Xposed implementation (eg. LSPosed)
2. Download and install the latest [Xposed module](https://github.com/revenge-mod/RevengeXposed/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk)
3. Enable the module
4. Force stop Discord

## 💖 Contributing

1. Follow the first two steps listed in [**⬇️ Installing**](#%EF%B8%8F-installing) section

2. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/revenge-mod/Revenge
   ```

3. Install dependencies
    ```
    pnpm install
    ```

4. Build Revenge
    ```
    pnpm run build
    ```

5. In the newly created `dist` directory, run a HTTP server. We recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

6. Go to **Settings** > **Developer**, enable **Load from custom URL**, and input the IP address and port of the server (e.g. `http://192.168.1.236:4040`) in the new input box labelled **REVENGE URL**.
   - If the **Developer** setting section doesn't appear, restart the app

7. Restart Discord. Upon reload, you should notice that your device will download Revenge's bundled code from your server, rather than GitHub.

8. Make your changes, rebuild, reload, go wild!
